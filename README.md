# PlayTennis
This project uses the Naive Bayes Classifier to determine whether or not to play tennis based on a few weather factors.
There are two files in this repository here:
  - The .py file
  - The .ipynb file
  
The .py file is the version I coded myself. The .ipynb file uses the Sci-kit learn framework in Jupyter Notebook to add a bit of flair to the program... Mainly the Naive Bayes Classifier built into Sci-kit learn.
Why are there two files?
  - Easy. We can trust Sci-kit learn to use the algorithm correctly but (it was an assignment, and) I coded my own version in case I had no access to Sci-kit learn and it helps me understand how the solution is found
